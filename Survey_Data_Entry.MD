## Data Structure and Overview
This project focuses on **manual data entry** from a **paper-based survey** into a structured digital format. The survey responses were entered into **Excel**, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

## Tools
- **Excel**: Used for data entry and validation.
- **CSV Format**: For storing entered data.
- **Paper-Based Surveys**: Original source of data.

## Dataset
- **Raw Survey Data (Scanned Copy)**: [View Survey Data](#) *(Replace with actual link)*
- **Entered Data in Excel**: [View Entered Data](https://github.com/Fathiat-data-portfolio/Fathiat_Data_Entry_Portfolio/blob/main/survey_data.csv)

## Why Data Entry?
Data entry is an essential process for converting raw information into a structured format, making it easier for analysis and decision-making. Proper data entry helps to:
- **Ensure data accuracy** and minimize errors.
- **Digitize and structure unorganized data**.
- **Prepare data for further analysis or visualization**.

## Executive Summary
The dataset originally consisted of **handwritten survey responses**. Through manual data entry, the responses were accurately transcribed into **Excel**, ensuring that they were **error-free, properly formatted, and ready for analysis**. The project demonstrates:
- **Attention to detail in manual data transcription**
- **Effective organization of survey responses**
- **Use of best practices to maintain data integrity**

## Insights Deep Dive
### Features Implemented:
- **Raw Data Before Entry**:
  The original dataset contained handwritten responses, requiring careful transcription.
  

- **Entered Data After Processing**:
  The responses were digitized, structured, and formatted correctly for analysis.

### Key Data Entry Techniques:
1. **Manual Data Entry with Validation** to prevent typographical errors.
2. **Use of Consistent Formatting** to ensure uniformity in responses.
3. **Double-Checking Entries** to maintain high accuracy.
4. **Saving Data in CSV Format** for easier storage and accessibility.

## Limitations
- **Human Error**: Despite careful validation, minor entry errors may still occur.
- **Time-Consuming**: Manual entry requires significant effort and attention to detail.
- **Data Interpretation Challenges**: Some handwritten responses were difficult to read.
