## Data Entry Process
1. **Gathering Lead Information**: Data was sourced from external forms and previous customer interactions.
2. **Cleaning & Structuring Data**: Removing duplicates, correcting inconsistencies.
3. **Entering Data into Salesforce**: Using the manual entry interface to ensure accurate lead classification.
4. **Assigning Lead Status**: Categorizing leads as **New, Contacted, Unqualified, or Converted** based on engagement level.

## Lead Status Management
Each lead is assigned a status to track the progress of potential customers:
- **New**: A fresh lead that has been entered but not yet engaged.
- **Contacted**: A lead that has been reached out to via email or call.
- **Unqualified**: A lead that does not meet business criteria.
- **Converted**: A lead that has successfully been turned into a customer.

## Key Insights
- **Accuracy is crucial** in data entry to prevent errors in sales tracking.
- **Consistent formatting** in CSV files makes Salesforce import smoother.
- **Lead categorization** helps prioritize follow-ups for better conversion.

## Limitations
- **Manual entry can be time-consuming** and may lead to occasional errors.
- **Data quality depends on the initial source**; incomplete information can affect accuracy.
